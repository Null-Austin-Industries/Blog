            Hello! I'm Austin, an independent developer and student passionate about building modern web applications and exploring new technologies.
            <br>
            On this blog, I share programming articles, tutorials, and insights from my projects, covering topics like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, backend development, and more. I enjoy learning about frameworks, open source tools, and best practices, and I aim to make complex concepts approachable for everyone. Whether you're a fellow developer, a student, or just curious about tech, I hope you'll find something useful here. Feel free to connect, ask questions, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
